# Todoey
This project was done in the iOS 11 & Swift4: The Complete iOS development bootcamp. 

It was initially developed using user defaults, then Core Data, and finally using Realm. We also used the Chameleon Framework for the UI colours and methods.

## What is it?
This is a to do list app, implemented using Realm database.
The user can create categories and delete them, as well as add items to those categories. Then, the user can check the items in the checklist or even delete them.

## The user interface
When the user creates a new category, the app generates a random colour. Then, the items in that category are shown in different shades of that colour.

## Watch it here!
